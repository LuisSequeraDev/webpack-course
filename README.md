This is a practice project for the webpack course, which integrates all the knowledge learned in each class, such as:
- Installation of webpack and construction of the project.
- Configuring webpack.config.js
- Babel loader for JS.
- HTML and webpack.
- Loaders for CSS and CSS preprocessors.
- Copy files with Webpack.
- Image loaders, fonts.
- Optimization: hashes, compression and minification of files.
- Webpack aliases.

Likewise, we repair errors, we deploy the project through "netlify.com", previously separating the environment variables (development mode and production mode), in addition to integrating Webpack Watch.

We saw add-on development tools like:
- Webpack DevServer.
- Webpack Bundle Analyzer.
- Webpack Dev Tools.
